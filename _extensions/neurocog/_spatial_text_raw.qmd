 
Constructing and recreating abstract visual designs (tangrams) from a model using flat polygons (tans) to reproduce each stimulus fell in the High Average range. 
Perceptual processing, discrimination, and pattern matching of a series of abstract images requiring close attention to visual detail was High Average. 
Copying of a complex figure requiring visuospatial integration, planning and organization, and efficient encoding of visuospatial material was Average.
